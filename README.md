# Assignment Description: Sentiment Analysis Tool For English Tweets

You want to implement a sentiment analysis tool for English tweets. For this purpose, in this project, you will develop a python program that will use the dataset in LMS to train a model to classify a tweet into one of the following three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral.

Your program should test the model using 10-fold cross validation. This means that you will randomly choose 90% of the data as training set and 10% of the data as test set. Then, using the training set, you should learn the parameters of the model and using the test set, you should test the model. This should be repeated 10 times. At the end, your program may print the average success of the model on the training and test sets.

Your grade will be determined by your report and the success of your model on the test set. The student with the highest test performance will get 100 if they properly prepare a report describing the methods they tried and demonstrates performances of these methods based on different parameters. Please look at the sample report in the LMS while preparing your report.
